# React Essencials



## STEPS

* Creating & Using a First Custom Component

*  Using & Outtiputting Dynamic Values [Core Concept]
We have a function that produce random numbers, and random index to access the word that we've defined before. In order to make our JSX code cleaner.

* Setting HTML Attributes Dynamically & Loading Image Files
Using a `import` statement `reactImg`(the name is up to you) from the file. It will include an automatically generated path that will also work once deploy the React app to a server.

* Making Components Reusable with Props [Core Concept]

* Alternative Props Syntaxes

* Storing Component Style Files Next To Components
Using `import default` to refer the files.

* Component Composition: The special `children` Prop [Core Concept]
